Quote Generator
The Quote Generator is a simple yet elegant web application designed to inspire and motivate users by displaying random quotes. Built with [Technology], this project focuses on seamless API integration, responsive design, and user-friendly interaction.

Features
Random Quote Generation: Fetches quotes from an API or uses a local dataset to display inspirational quotes.
Shareable Quotes: Users can share quotes directly to social media platforms, spreading positivity.
Responsive Design: Optimized for all devices, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Customizable UI: Easy to modify colors, fonts, and layouts for a personalized experience.
API Integration
This project integrates with a public API to fetch quotes. However, due to potential CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions, you need to use a proxy service to bypass these issues.

How to Use the API
To access the API, you must prepend your API requests with:
https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/

For example:

javascript
Copy code
fetch('https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://api.example.com/quotes')  
  .then(response => response.json())  
  .then(data => console.log(data));  
Ensure that you enable the proxy service by visiting its homepage and clicking the "Request temporary access" button before making API requests.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React, Vue, etc.)
API Integration: Fetch API for seamless data retrieval
Proxy Service: CORS Anywhere for bypassing CORS restrictions
